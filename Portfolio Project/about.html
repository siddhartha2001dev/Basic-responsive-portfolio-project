            <h3>Professional Summary:</h3>
            <p>
                I am an enthusiastic and highly motivated Electronics and Communication Engineering undergraduate, currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) from Techno India University. My academic path is rooted in a diploma in Electrical Engineering from Technique Polytechnic Institute, which has equipped me with a robust foundation in core engineering concepts and a practical, problem-solving mindset.

Over time, I have developed a deep interest in the fields of software development and web technologies, particularly front-end development. I possess a strong command of modern web technologies including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and front-end development frameworks such as Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS. My expertise lies in crafting responsive, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing web interfaces that focus on performance, accessibility, and user experience (UI/UX). I am continually expanding my technical toolkit and staying current with the latest trends in web standards and design principles.

In addition to my technical acumen, I am proficient in programming languages like C, C++, and Python, along with a foundational understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms, which supports my logical thinking and development practices. My problem-solving skills are complemented by a keen eye for design and functionality, allowing me to bridge the gap between technical execution and creative presentation.

Beyond academics, I am a multifaceted individual with a passion for the creative arts. I actively pursue hobbies such as singing, photography, videography, sound design using FL Studio, and digital illustration with Procreate. These creative endeavors fuel my innovation and adaptability, traits that are invaluable in today’s rapidly evolving tech landscape.

I am currently seeking challenging and growth-oriented opportunities in the tech and IT sectors, particularly in roles related to front-end development, UI/UX design, and software engineering, where I can contribute effectively, continue learning, and thrive as both a professional and an individual.
