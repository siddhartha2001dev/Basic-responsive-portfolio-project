      <h4>Responsive portfolio Website :</h4>
      <br/>
      <p>Hello and welcome! I’ve recently developed and launched my personal portfolio website, which serves as a central hub for showcasing my front-end development work. The complete source code and related assets for the site are available on my GitHub account, reflecting my commitment to clean, organized, and maintainable code. This website not only highlights my technical skills and design sensibilities but also provides a structured space where I will continue to upload and document my front-end projects as they are developed. Moving forward, it will serve as a dynamic platform for demonstrating my growth, creativity, and dedication to crafting responsive, user-friendly web experiences </p>

      <h4>Flap Quest (Responsive flappy bird clone):</h4>
      <br/>
      <p>Flap Quest is an interactive 2D browser-based game inspired by the classic Flappy Bird. Developed entirely using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, this project showcases efficient use of DOM manipulation, event handling, and real-time animations to deliver a smooth and engaging gameplay experience.The objective of the game is simple yet challenging: guide the bird through an endless series of pipes without colliding. The game dynamically adjusts difficulty over time, encouraging player focus and reflexes. It features responsive design principles to ensure compatibility across various screen sizes and modern web browsers. Also I designed the assets used in this project by myself with the help of procreate for 2D designs graphics images.

      <h4>Digital Art and Logo Design:</h4>

      <p>My digital art portfolio showcases a range of creative works that explore visual storytelling, color theory, and composition through a digital medium. Each piece is the result of a thoughtful process that combines traditional artistic techniques with modern digital tools. From conceptual illustrations to character design and abstract experimentation, my work reflects both technical skill and a personal artistic voice. I use industry-standard software and hardware to bring ideas to life, focusing on detail, mood, and visual impact. This collection highlights my versatility as a digital artist and my commitment to pushing creative boundaries</p>
